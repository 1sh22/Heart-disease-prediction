# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
In today's health-conscious world, the prevention of heart diseases is of paramount importance. The development of robust, data-driven systems for heart disease prediction has revolutionized research and prevention efforts, offering the promise of healthier lives for countless individuals. At the forefront of this transformative journey is the realm of Machine Learning, where the power of data meets the precision of predictive analysis.

Within this project, a comprehensive examination of a heart disease patient dataset was carried out, encompassing meticulous data processing to ensure the quality and accuracy of the information. A series of Machine Learning models were then skillfully trained, using diverse algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and more.

This work culminated in the creation of a Jupyter notebook code, seamlessly integrated with a dedicated dataset that served as the cornerstone of the Kaggle kernel 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras.' The primary objective was to tackle a crucial classification problemâ€”predicting the presence of heart disease in a patient.

The Machine Learning algorithms harnessed for this endeavor encompassed a wide spectrum of techniques:

1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (Scikit-learn)
5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
7. XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
8. An Artificial Neural Network with a Single Hidden Layer (Keras)

This robust approach yielded remarkable results, with an accuracy rate peaking at 95%, particularly notable in the case of the Random Forest algorithm.
